### The Problem
For this assignment you’ll analyze the veteran built-in dataset in the survival package. In this dataset, 137 males with advanced inoperable lung cancer were randomized to either a standard or an experimental chemotherapy; subsequent survival times are recorded (in days), along with the type of treatment received (“test” means experimental) and several other variables (see help(veteran)).

Please describe the data (overall mortality rates, survival times, and patterns) both in words and with graphical summaries, and perform an analysis to determine which variables are significantly associated with survival, and in particular whether the experimental chemotherapy differs significantly from the standard treatment. Be sure to communicate both real-world significance as well as statistical uncertainty.

Your report should include both Kaplan-Meier plots with multiple curves for different categories, as well as survival curves predicted by a fitted model that incorporates other covariates.
