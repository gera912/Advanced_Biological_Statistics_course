Two-quarter graduate course aims to provide students with practical understanding of and experience with core concepts and methods in modern data analysis. 

The focus is on biological data, but skills will be transferable to other disciplines. Students will become familiar with major topics in univariate and multivariate statistics, analysis of large data sets, and Bayesian analysis. There is a particular emphasis on modeling and conceptual understanding of statistical noise and uncertainty. 

The course is advanced in that we will move through the material quickly with the goal of providing a solid foundation for subsequent learning. Students will learn to use the powerful statistical programming language R, and the flexible modeling package Stan. Prerequisites: some (basic) programming.
