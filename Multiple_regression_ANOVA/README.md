### The problem

Researchers are studying how levels of the hormone IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) affect early growth, and have measured IGF-1 levels along with length, weight, and a few maturity-related traits in 655 young mice. Your goal is to investigate how IGF-1 is related to differences in length after accounting for other factors. The dataset is here: igf.tsv, and has variables age (in weeks), sex, igf (IGF-1 levels), maturity (1-5, larger values are more sexually mature), weight (in g), and length (body and tail, in cm).

Describe the data, fit and compare linear models, and provide visualizations and summaries of what you find.
